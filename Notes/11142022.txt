So I have the array of legends that will be available every single time someone clicks on one. What I need to happen is that I need the most current legend to be put in the box. 
Everytime a legend is clicked there is a corresponding value that is stored. I should be able to use that value, and display the correct legend on the screen. One of my biggest concerns, I'm guessing is going  obe rerendering the data every single time one legend is clicked. I'm assuming that I can use the smae type of logic I used for the random number generator. Because the values within that generator are going to correspond to the name that will be used.
