Instead of using thos janky icons that i found on the internet, I could instead use the ones from font-awesome. Those would have a uniform look and in the end, it would be alot cleaner too.

Idk what happend but Font awesome locked me out of my damn account. I'm going to have to try again because the last time, I had no idea what to do even AFTER resestting my password.
